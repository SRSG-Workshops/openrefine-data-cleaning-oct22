An important part of the data analysis pipeline is preparing the data for analysis. Some of this
involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identified and corrected 
or data structure and formatting made consistent. This step must be taken with the same care and attention
to reproducibility as the data analysis itself.

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful free and open source tool 
for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another.

This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to clean and format
data effectively and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment
that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these
edits by hand or in spreadsheet programmes such as Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice or OpenOffice.

> ## Getting Started
> This lesson assumes no prior knowledge of the computational skills or tools apart from the basic 
> understanding of tabular data stored in spreadsheets.
>
> To get started, follow the directions in the "[Setup](setup/)" section to download OpenRefine and 
>lesson data to your computer.
